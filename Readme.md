# Pima Indian Diabetes Prediction


This project aims to analyze the medical factors of a patient, such as Glucose Level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin Level, and many others, to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not.

#### About the Dataset

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on selecting these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, etc.
